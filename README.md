# git-cleanup ðŸ§¹

A simple script to clean your remote local branches without a remote one.

## Getting started

Download the script:

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grizio/git-cleanup/master/git-cleanup > git-cleanup
```

Use it:

```
./git-cleanup
```

## Other tricks

### Add this script globally

```
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/grizio/git-cleanup/master/git-cleanup > /usr/local/bin/git-cleanup
```

### Use it as a git command

Once the script is in `/usr/local/bin` or anywhere in your `${PATH}`, you can use it as a git command:

```
git cleanup
``` 

## Comes with some security

Instead of forcing the deletion of all your branches, you can review the branches to delete before executing the cleaning.
